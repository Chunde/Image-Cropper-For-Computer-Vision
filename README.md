# About
These code was developed many years ago, I decide to share them with the community, they may be not well engineered, but should be not hard to read. I did not write much comment. If you find these code is helpful, cheers! 
By the way, these source includes lots of controls and libraries that would be very useful for other purpose, without much documentation, it's a bit hard to re-use them. But for experienced developer, it may be not difficulty when you read how these controls and libraries are used in the image cropper project. 
# Image-Cropper-For-Computer-Vision
The software tool contains multiple projects, most of the code is written in C#, some part in C++, and little in assemble language. Some other source files not used for this project are also include due to historical reasons, I keep them 
# Compile
Please use Visual Studio 2010 or later to compile these projects. The App use the DirectX code for C# from Microsoft, which may not be compiled using VS 2013 or 2015, you need to retarget that project to VC 100 if thing goes wrong. 
# Using Binary Setup File
I also include a binary setup file, so you do not have to compile the source. Cheers~
# Run
Code is tested under debug mode, it probably has some issues when comes to release mode, however, they can be fixed easily, I may need to clean them up a bit.
# How to Use
As a user and developer, I had tried my best to make this tool easy to use based on my personal preference and experience. Please check the video on using the tool
