#About
These code was developed many years ago, I decide to share them with the community, they may be not well engineered, but should be not hard to read. I did not write much comment, as I dislike commenting code, LOL. If you find these code is helpful, cheer! 
# Image-Cropper-For-Computer-Vision
The software tool contains multiple projects, most of the code is written in C#, some part in C++, and little in assemble language. 
#Compile
Please use Visual Studion 2010 or later to compile these projects.
#Run
Code is tested under debug mode, it probably has some issues when comes to release mode, however, they can be fixed easily, I may need to clean them up a bit.
